# Ruben Estevez

Hi welcome to the team!

## My Role

I am an Agile Team Lead for the Blue Team in Application Services. My goals are to set up the team with context for success and to promote the following:

1. Psychological safety.

2. Sharing experience and expertise within the team to grow and retain high performing individuals.

3. Generous communication and feedback.

4. Constant learning.

## Availability

I try to keep my calendar updated. Please feel free to book time if you want to discuss something or want my undivided attention. Some days my calendar will not have open slots in it. If that is the case and you have something to chat about or need something from me, please slack me and I will try my best to make time.

If you need to communicate with me outside work hours, I try to always be available on slack. I appreciated if you could tell me in the message if it is something urgent or not.

## My Expectations

This is something that we will discuss more in depth once you get onboarded onto the team. Here is a small list of expectation for you to have a general idea:

1. You love teamwork and strive for a friendly environment.

2. You are engaged in, and agree with, the team process.

3. You like to own decisions as a team and share success/failures as a group.

4. You hold yourself and your teammates accountable.

5. You love code reviews and give constructive feedback.

6. You write descriptive commit and pull request messages.

7. You keep all back-and-forth communication about a feature inside the Azure DevOps card or in an email. You don’t communicate about features in a place where it’s not possible for me or a team member to access down the road.

## 1:1s

One-on-ones is your time and I will do my best to prioritize over other meetings. I encourage you to book something on my calendar once a sprint (every two weeks) for 30 mins. If you need more time with me, feel free to book a longer session.

I usually will have a question of the sprint that will drive the conversation, but I strongly encourage you to bring items that you would like to discuss with me that you would not bring up in a group setting. For example: How are you doing? is there anything bothering you? thoughts on your career and goals, etc. I like for you to be as honest and open as you can. I keep 1:1s private.

If you have something urgent to discuss with me, you don’t have to wait for our 1:1 to happen, feel free to book a meeting earlier.

## Feedback Protocol 

I tend to give feedback on every 1:1 but if I have fresh feedback to give to you, I will try to provide it as soon as possible. Currently on the team we are working on improving the feedback loop by trying out Feedback Week but this is a work in progress.
